                  In most developing countries, pension systems are poorly developed and the elderly rely on their children for old-age support. However, with increasing trends in rural-to-urban migration, many elder parents are left alone with limited assistance. This paper investigates whether parents may strategically lower the education investment in children to reduce the probability of their children out-migrating. In particular, I examine whether the Hukou reforms, which greatly relaxed migration restrictions in rural China, had detrimental effects on educational investments. Exploiting the variation in the timing of Hukou reforms across prefectures and cohorts, I show that the probability of children being enrolled in high school decreases by 0.096 standard deviations if the Hukou restrictions at high-school entry age are relaxed by one standard deviation. The effect is more substantial for parents whose ideal living arrangement for the elderly is to live near their children. Furthermore, the negative effects exist for parents without pension entitlement, not those with pension entitlement. This suggests that in contexts with weak policies for old-age support, lifting migration restrictions may have detrimental effects on human capital accumulation.

              <details>
                  <summary> Abstract </summary>
                  Robots have been increasingly adopted in production processes throughout the world. This paper evaluates the impact of industrial robots on labor markets and political attitudes in China. Based on robot data from Chinese customs, I construct a direct measurement of robot exposure for each prefecture. Exploiting the variation in robot exposure across years and prefectures, I find that robots have no effect on general employment and wages, but there is heterogeneity regarding firm types. However, I find important effects on unrest: one more robot per thousand workers leads to 1.6 times more episodes of labor unrest. This indicates the replacement effects of robots on labor could generate substantial discontent among some sectors, even though may not generate aggregate negative employment effects. I also explore the effects on individual attitudes using the China Family Panel Studies. I construct an individual exposure to robots based on occupational vulnerability. I find that exposure to robots negatively affects people's evaluation of the government's performance and trust in the local government.

                  <summary> Abstract </summary>
                  This study examines the effects of children's sex on women's sex preferences and investigates the underlying mechanisms. Women's sex preference is measured by the proportion of sons and daughters they would like to have. Based on data from a national representative sample of Peruvian women in the Demographic and Health Survey, we find that if the first child is a daughter, the ideal proportion of sons will be lower by 6.2 percentage points (pp), and the ideal proportion of daughters will be higher by 5.3 pp. Moreover, if the first two children are daughters, the ideal proportion of sons will be lower by 8.9 pp, and the ideal proportion of daughters will be higher by 6.2 pp. Further analysis shows that the effects of the sex of the first child are stronger for women with only one child than for women with multiple children and that the effects of having a daughter depend on her birth order, suggesting that both preference adaptation and learning play important roles in generating the effects of children's sex on parental sex preference.
